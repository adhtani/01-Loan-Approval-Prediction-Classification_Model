# Project 1 - Loan Approval Prediction - Classification Model
   
**Introduction**  
  
Dream Housing Finance company is a growing company that provides Home loans in all over US Areas. They first check the eligibility of the customers before customers apply for the application. The company is interested in automating the pre-approval eligibility process by evaluating the customer's data provided by them on the application. This is important, as this provides the customer their likelihood of getting approved before they apply for the loan. The data is provided by the company to determine the eligibility of the customer so they can target these customers. There are many factors that can determine the eligibility of the customer, such as education level, Income, Credit History, etc.
For this project, I will attempt to analyze what factors are significant in approving the loan, to predict who will get approved for the loan.
Problem Statement: Predict which customer is eligible for loan based on their background information.
